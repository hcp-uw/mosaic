### The cloud that belongs to everyone.

Mosaic is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud storage network that lets users contribute their own unused storage to a shared, decentralized cloud. In return, they gain access to secure, distributed file storage and retrieval.

Instead of relying on centralized servers, Mosaic forms a collaborative storage mesh—where every participant helps strengthen the network. This approach enhances security, resilience, and accessibility; no single point of failure can compromise your data.

In essence, Mosaic turns individual devices into building blocks of a global cloud.
